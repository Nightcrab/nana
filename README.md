# Nana

--------------------------

Nana is a game searching program for multi-agent games based on tetrominoes. 

Compared to other solvers, Nana notably supports:

* Zero-sum games
* Large branching factors
* Random chance
* Hidden information
* Efficient parallelisation
* Online any-time planning

## Usage

To use, Nana needs to be built from its C++ source code. (no distributions available yet)

Note: Parallelisation is available on shared memory models only.
